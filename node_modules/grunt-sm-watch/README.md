# grunt-sm-watch

Grunt SublimeText task runner. Drop-in replacement for grunt-contrib-watch plugin.

## Getting Started
_If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide._

From the same directory as your project's [Gruntfile][Getting Started] and [package.json][], install this plugin with the following command:

```bash
npm install grunt-sm-watch --save-dev
```

Once that's done, add this line to your project's Gruntfile:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-sm-watch');
```

If the plugin has been installed correctly, running `grunt --help` at the command line should list the newly-installed plugin's task or tasks. In addition, the plugin should be listed in package.json as a `devDependency`, which ensures that it will be installed whenever the `npm install` command is run.
